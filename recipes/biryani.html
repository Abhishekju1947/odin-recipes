            <li>onions, garlic, ginger</li>
            <li>whole spices like cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, cumin seeds, coriander seeds</li>

        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Marinate the meat:</strong>
                Combine meat with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, cumin-coriander powder, garam masala, and salt. 
                Let marinate for at least 30 minutes or ideally a few hours in the refrigerator. </li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the spice base:</strong>
                Heat ghee or oil in a pot, add whole spices like cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and bay leaves. 
                Once fragrant, add sliced onions and cook until golden brown and caramelized. 
                Add ginger-garlic paste and cook for a minute or two. </li>
            <li><strong>Cook the meat:</strong>
                Add the marinated meat to the pot and cook until partially done, stirring occasionally. </li>
            <li><strong>Layering and cooking (dum):</strong>
                Spread a layer of the cooked meat mixture at the bottom of the pot. 
                Top it with a layer of soaked basmati rice, sprinkle with saffron strands mixed in warm milk, and add a few fresh herbs like cilantro and mint. 
                Repeat layers until all ingredients are used up. 
                Cover the pot tightly with a lid and seal the edges with dough to create a steam-tight seal. 
                Cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes, allowing the rice to absorb the flavors and cook through. </li>
            <li><strong>Serving:</strong>
                Once cooked, let the biryani rest for a few minutes before gently fluffing the rice with a fork and serving hot with raita or salad. </li>                
        </ol>
